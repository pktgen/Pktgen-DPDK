# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and productive environment for all contributors and users of Pktgen-DPDK.

This project adopts (by reference) the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) (Version 2.1) as the foundation of expected behavior.

## 1. Scope

Applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, community chats, and any project-related events.

## 2. Summary of Expectations

- Be respectful, inclusive, and patient.
- Provide constructive feedback; focus on ideas, not individuals.
- Use welcoming and professional language; avoid harassment or discrimination.
- Assume good intent while clarifying misunderstandings.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior (Examples)

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any form.
- Personal or political attacks.
- Trolling, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Conduct inconsistent with professional standards.

## 4. Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Preferred: Open a confidential issue labeled `coc-report` (omit sensitive personal details; maintainers will follow up privately), or
- Email the maintainers (if listed in `README.md`) with details: date/time, participants, context, and any supporting material.

Reports will be handled promptly, respectfully, and—when requested—confidentially.

## 5. Enforcement

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. Actions may include (progressively, as appropriate):

1. Informal warning
1. Formal written warning
1. Temporary exclusion from discussions or repository interactions
1. Permanent ban from project spaces

Severe violations (e.g. threats, doxxing, hate speech) may result in immediate permanent removal without prior warning.

## 6. Appeals

If you believe an enforcement decision was made in error, you may request a review by contacting the maintainers with a concise rationale.

## 7. Attribution

This document is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, Version 2.1.
