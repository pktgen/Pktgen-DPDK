 - 3.2.9 - fixed a number of problems and some code cleanup
           Fixed the problem when running a lua script the ports stats were not updated.
           The problem is a rte_timer_manage() call was remove my mistake.

           Convert over to use CLI interface instead of cmdline interface.
           CLI is a directory like command line tool and please read the .rst file in the lib/cli directory
           Many bug fixes.
 - 3.1.2 - Convert spaces to tabs and add pktgen-cfg.[ch] page
           Converting the spaces to tabs to allow for editing the code with tabs
           set to 4 or 8 columns per tab. Changed to allow people who are stuck
           on a tab=8 columns. We have modern computers tabs=4 columns seems reasonable.
 - 3.1.1 - Minor cleanup of top level directory and code.
 - 3.1.0 - Rename functions and files.
           When files are written change the file modes to 0666 as they are owned by root.
           More general cleanup of the display refresh.
           loading command or lua files is faster because of the screen updates fixed.
 - 3.0.17- Fixed a formating issue on sequence page for port numbers.
           Save of lua code wrong for pktgen.range() should be pktgen.set_range().
 - 3.0.16- Add command line option to strip CRC in hardware one RX.
           Option is '--crc-strip' which strips the CRC on RX for all ports.
 - 3.0.15- Update Lua to 5.3.3 version187
           Change lua pktgen.range() to pktgen.set_range() plus added
           the range commands from pktgen.dst_mac() to pktgen.range.dst_mac().
           Still support the old commands for now.
           Now polls the RX and TX queues to support eth_bond interfaces using
           mode 4 or LACP.
 - 3.0.14- Fix crash in saving configuration and random is not setup.
 - 3.0.13- Fix seq only sending the first sequence packet and some cleanup.
 - 3.0.12- Map port/queue pair stats to the correct lcore.
 - 3.0.11- Fix compile problem with 16.04
 - 3.0.10- Added the 'pdump <portlist>' command to hex dump the first packet to be
           send on the given ports. Only the single packet mode is supported.
 - 3.0.09- Add Fix for PCAP corruption.
 - 3.0.08- Add Lua support for rnd and latency commands.
           Now if latency is enable on a port then getting the stats will get
           the latency values via lua table.
 - 3.0.07- Fixed crash on exit when using more then one core per port.
 - 3.0.06- Fix PCI null pointer when using virtual devices.
           Removed the C11 constructs to compile on C99 compilers.
           Fix the bug of old packets after changes for new run.
           The problem is DPDK holds on to the mbufs in the TX done queue
           and those can not be changed. With 16.07 we can find all of the mbufs
           and changed them to correct format/sizes.
 - 3.0.05- New Latency/Jitter page 'page latency'
           Need to adjust the packet size to 96 to allow for latency timestamp.
           type: page latency
           latency 0 on
           set 0 size 96
           start 0
 - 3.0.04- Display reported the wrong rate in Mbits because the counters were not
           including the FCS bytes in the value as it was before.
           Minor cleanup of the code for formating.
 - 3.0.03- General clean up of scripts
           Add support for share library builds
           Clean up formating

           Fix the missing pthread.h include in lua socket header.
           Add the rnd lua support APIs
           Fix the checksum issue with rnd changes.
 - 3.0.01- Fixed the Range sequence and VLAN problem.
 - 3.0.00- Fixed code to ifdef the imcasts counters that were deprecated.
 - 2.9.18- Fix the range command to set IP proto value and be able to save that value.
 - 2.9.17- Fix PCAP crash when using multiple tx queues.
 - 2.9.16- Fix include problems with cmdline_parse.h file.
           missing cmdline_parse_token_hdr_t define and looks like the header was not
           included in the pktgen-seq.h file for DPDK v2.2.0 and pktgen-2.9.15
 - 2.9.15- Update Lua to version 5.3.2
 - 2.9.14- Fix compiler error for gcc-4.9 and inet_ntop() routine
 - 2.9.13- Add max last seen RX/TX packets to display.
 - 2.9.12- Was not able to set IP protocol type for range packets.
           New command range.proto <portlist> udp|tcp|icmp
           Lua command is pktgen.ip_proto("all", "udp")
 - 2.9.11- Fix version string for new version style in DPDK.
 - 2.9.10- Reformat the code and get ready for the next release of DPDK.
 - 2.9.9 - Update the init screen output to not screw up DPDK screen output.
 - 2.9.8 - Fixed the crash when using the sequence packets.
 - 2.9.7 - Changed all rte_zmalloc to rte_zmalloc_socket calls and change seq_pkt support.
           The fix for multiple cores accessing seq_pkts was to allocate memory and copy
           into a private area. This sometimes caused memory allocation problems, so I
           removed the allocation and used spinlocks around the code. Most likely slower
           in some areas but better then allocating memory.
 - 2.9.6 - Add support for different pattern types and a user patten string.
           New commands are 'pattern <portlist> type'.
           Types are abc, none, zero or user
           New command 'user.pattern <portlist> <string>' The string can not contain a space
           which is a limitation of the rte_cmdline code.
           Added new Lua command for the above 'pattern(<portlist>, <type>)'
           and 'userPatten(<portlist>, <string>)'
 - 2.9.5 - Fixed sequence packet race condition for multiple senders.
 - 2.9.4 - Fixed the ARP sends were not being flushed
 - 2.9.3 - Remove change log and comment out the eth stop when done sending.
           This will most likely screw up the pcap and others, but stopping the port is not good.
 - 2.9.1 - Fix up the sequeue help to remove vlan option with ipv4/ipv6
 - 2.9.0 - Update to DPDK 2.0.0 and Lua 5.3.0 with README update.
 - 2.8.6 - Fix argument for rte_mempool_create, which caused a crash.
 - 2.8.5 - Fix compat problem with latest Pktgen and DPDK 1.8.0
 - 2.8.4 - Minor updates for comments.
 - 2.8.3 - Updated the Makefiles to use rte.extXYZ.mk files.
           Updated the code to build with DPDK 2.0.0-rc1 as some function prototype changed.
 - 2.8.2 - Fix bug in pktgen_main_receive routine not using the correct port number.
 - 2.8.1 - Add a new docs directory using Sphinx format and update version numbers.
 - 2.8.0 - Update to release 1.8.0 of DPDK.
 - 2.7.7 - Update Lua to 5.2.3 and fixed setting vlan ID on single ports plus added new Lua functions
			 New Lua functions are pktgen.portCount() and pktgen.totalPorts() portCount() is the number of
			 port used by Pktgen and totalPorts() is the total number seen by DPDK.
 - 2.7.6 - Update code from dpdk.org version of Pktgen, which hopefull fixes the send foreve problem.
 - 2.7.5 - Update to latest dpdk.org and move scrn to lib directory with name changes.
 - 2.7.4 - Removed old printf_info() calls for printf_status() calls.
 - 2.7.3 - Fixed race condition with updating the TX count value with a small count.
 - 2.7.1 - Add a command line option '-T' to enable themes and set themes off by default.
 - 2.7.0 - Update to DPDK 1.7.0, Note: DPDK 1.7.0 changed how ports are detected and blacklisted,
           which means the port index is now different. You will need to blacklist or whitelist ports
           with the DPDK '-b' or '--pci-blacklist or --pci-whitelist' options. Pktgen does not blacklist
           ports anymore.
           - Moved pktgen to the examples directory plus removed the libwr_* from the lib directory
           - Pktgen now supports ANSI color terminals only the main screen ATM, but more later.
           - Best viewed on a black background display, unless you want to change it with the new theme commands.

 - 2.6.4 - It consists of 3 commits: improvements to the pktgen-random.c unit tests,
           the real CentOS compilation fixes and a small update to tap.{c,h} so they
           are identical to those from zorgnax/libtap on github.
 - 2.6.3 - Add a delay when traffic stops to make sure all packets are sent.
           Remove the `rte_hash_crc.h` include in wr_pcap.c file.

           address to help support a special request for failover support.
           Added support for DPDK 1.5.1
 - 2.2.7 - Updated the code to handle multiple TX queues per port.
