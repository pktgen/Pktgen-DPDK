Pktgen-DPDK - Traffic Generator powered by DPDK
=====================================================

**Pktgen-DPDK is a traffic generator powered by DPDK at wire rate traffic with 64 byte frames.**

** (Pktgen) Sounds like 'Packet-Gen'**

**=== Modifications ===**
 - 23.06.0 - Fix up problem using "all" with portlist routines.
 - 23.03.1 - In latency mode avg_cycles was only calculated when not using Lua.
 - 23.03.0 - Update and fix a number of issues with latency. Some values were not updated
             or displayed on screen or in a Lua script when getting port stats.
             Latency packets are not able to be sent in any mode, instead of only being able
             to send and report latencies in latency mode.
             When using a portlist in lua it can be a single port in a string, a string range
             or a single port using a Lua Number or Integer
 - 22.07.2 - Changed the number of queues from 16 to 64.
 - 22.07.1 - Update copyright dates and other minor fixes
 - 22.07.0 - Add new rx/tx burst options.
             Fix GUI build and stats.
             Make build with DPDK more compatible.
             Add max latency reporting.
             Allow building on RISC-V platforms.
             Add new rfc2455 script
             Increase the number of mbufs allocated to support better performance.
             Add restart command to try and cleanup the DPDK PMD or mbufs a start RX/TX.

 - 22.04.1 - Fix Lua build issues around new stats structure changes.
 - 22.02.0 - Remove the backward compatability builds with older versions of DPDK.
             It has become too difficult to maintain building with older versions and I believe
             the older DPDK version builds did not work as expected. Please only build DPDK with
             the lastest version of DPDK or at least the previous version, but I do not guarantee
             it will work. I will try to keep up with the latest release version of DPDK.

 - 3.2.9 - fixed a number of problems and some code cleanup
           Fixed the problem when running a lua script the ports stats were not updated.
           The problem is a rte_timer_manage() call was remove my mistake.

           Many bug fixes.
 - 3.1.2 - Convert spaces to tabs and add pktgen-cfg.[ch] page
           Converting the spaces to tabs to allow for editing the code with tabs
           set to 4 or 8 columns per tab. Changed to allow people who are stuck
           on a tab=8 columns. We have modern computers tabs=4 columns seems reasonable.

           Option is '--crc-strip' which strips the CRC on RX for all ports.
 - 3.0.15- Update Lua to 5.3.3 version187
           Change lua pktgen.range() to pktgen.set_range() plus added

           Still support the old commands for now.
           Now polls the RX and TX queues to support eth_bond interfaces using
           mode 4 or LACP.
 - 3.0.14- Fix crash in saving configuration and random is not setup.
 - 3.0.13- Fix seq only sending the first sequence packet and some cleanup.

           send on the given ports. Only the single packet mode is supported.
 - 3.0.09- Add Fix for PCAP corruption.
 - 3.0.08- Add Lua support for rnd and latency commands.
           Now if latency is enable on a port then getting the stats will get
           the latency values via lua table.
 - 3.0.07- Fixed crash on exit when using more then one core per port.
 - 3.0.06- Fix PCI null pointer when using virtual devices.
           Removed the C11 constructs to compile on C99 compilers.
           Fix the bug of old packets after changes for new run.
           The problem is DPDK holds on to the mbufs in the TX done queue
           and those can not be changed. With 16.07 we can find all of the mbufs
           and changed them to correct format/sizes.
 - 3.0.05- New Latency/Jitter page 'page latency'
           Need to adjust the packet size to 96 to allow for latency timestamp.
           type: page latency
           latency 0 on
           set 0 size 96
           start 0
 - 3.0.04- Display reported the wrong rate in Mbits because the counters were not
           including the FCS bytes in the value as it was before.
           Minor cleanup of the code for formating.

           Fix the missing pthread.h include in lua socket header.
           Add the rnd lua support APIs
           Fix the checksum issue with rnd changes.
 - 3.0.01- Fixed the Range sequence and VLAN problem.

 - 2.9.17- Fix PCAP crash when using multiple tx queues.
 - 2.9.16- Fix include problems with cmdline_parse.h file.
           missing cmdline_parse_token_hdr_t define and looks like the header was not
           included in the pktgen-seq.h file for DPDK v2.2.0 and pktgen-2.9.15
 - 2.9.15- Update Lua to version 5.3.2
 - 2.9.14- Fix compiler error for gcc-4.9 and inet_ntop() routine
 - 2.9.13- Add max last seen RX/TX packets to display.
 - 2.9.12- Was not able to set IP protocol type for range packets.
           New command range.proto <portlist> udp|tcp|icmp
           Lua command is pktgen.ip_proto("all", "udp")
 - 2.9.11- Fix version string for new version style in DPDK.
 - 2.9.10- Reformat the code and get ready for the next release of DPDK.
 - 2.9.9 - Update the init screen output to not screw up DPDK screen output.
 - 2.9.8 - Fixed the crash when using the sequence packets.
 - 2.9.7 - Changed all rte_zmalloc to rte_zmalloc_socket calls and change seq_pkt support.
           The fix for multiple cores accessing seq_pkts was to allocate memory and copy
           into a private area. This sometimes caused memory allocation problems, so I
           removed the allocation and used spinlocks around the code. Most likely slower
           in some areas but better then allocating memory.
 - 2.9.6 - Add support for different pattern types and a user patten string.
           New commands are 'pattern <portlist> type'.
           Types are abc, none, zero or user
           New command 'user.pattern <portlist> <string>' The string can not contain a space
           which is a limitation of the rte_cmdline code.
           Added new Lua command for the above 'pattern(<portlist>, <type>)'
           and 'userPatten(<portlist>, <string>)'
 - 2.9.5 - Fixed sequence packet race condition for multiple senders.
 - 2.9.4 - Fixed the ARP sends were not being flushed
 - 2.9.3 - Remove change log and comment out the eth stop when done sending.
           This will most likely screw up the pcap and others, but stopping the port is not good.
 - 2.9.1 - Fix up the sequeue help to remove vlan option with ipv4/ipv6
 - 2.9.0 - Update to DPDK 2.0.0 and Lua 5.3.0 with README update.
 - 2.8.6 - Fix argument for rte_mempool_create, which caused a crash.

 - 2.8.1 - Add a new docs directory using Sphinx format and update version numbers.
 - 2.8.0 - Update to release 1.8.0 of DPDK.
 - 2.7.7 - Update Lua to 5.2.3 and fixed setting vlan ID on single ports plus added new Lua functions
			 New Lua functions are pktgen.portCount() and pktgen.totalPorts() portCount() is the number of
			 port used by Pktgen and totalPorts() is the total number seen by DPDK.
 - 2.7.6 - Update code from dpdk.org version of Pktgen, which hopefull fixes the send foreve problem.
 - 2.7.5 - Update to latest dpdk.org and move scrn to lib directory with name changes.
 - 2.7.4 - Removed old printf_info() calls for printf_status() calls.
 - 2.7.3 - Fixed race condition with updating the TX count value with a small count.
 - 2.7.1 - Add a command line option '-T' to enable themes and set themes off by default.
 - 2.7.0 - Update to DPDK 1.7.0, Note: DPDK 1.7.0 changed how ports are detected and blocklisted,
           which means the port index is now different. You will need to blocklist or allowlist ports
           with the DPDK '-b' or '--pci-blocklist or --pci-allowlist' options. Pktgen does not blocklist
           ports anymore.
           - Moved pktgen to the examples directory plus removed the libwr_* from the lib directory
           - Pktgen now supports ANSI color terminals only the main screen ATM, but more later.
           - Best viewed on a black background display, unless you want to change it with the new theme commands.
