Lua
---

Lua Version 5.3.0.

Lua is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language. Lua combines simple
procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on
associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by
interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic
memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for
configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.

SOFTWARE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY WIND RIVER, ITS
DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES SHALL IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE
OF THIS WARRANTY. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion
of implied warranties or how long an implied warranty may last, so the above

DOLLARS ($100). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages so this limitation and exclusion may not
apply to Customer.

THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE
BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN WIND RIVER AND CUSTOMER. WIND RIVER WOULD NOT BE
ABLE TO PROVIDE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.
